# alexa-git   
Just another one of my crazy ideas.    
  
    
## Idea:  
The idea of this project is so that I can listen to new things on my git feed every single day. However, after asking many different people about potential uses of this product, they've all indicated that it would be something cool they'd like to have. So, I'm going to make it.    
Tack onto that the fact that I have one calculus final coming up later, but that doesn't matter. It's in another two weeks, so I don't really need to study till next week. This means I've got a week to kill. I want to completely automate my morning, news, reddit, etc. etc. and this is a part of it. I'll have a subreddit bot up soon.
